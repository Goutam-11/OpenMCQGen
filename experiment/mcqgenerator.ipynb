In our advanced analytics courses, we ask students to find projects that align with their majors and the university’s mission of building community and being of service to others. As part of this semesterlong assignment, students must find a publicly available dataset that includes words—not just numbers—and start by cleaning up the data using Tableau Prep. Next, they use Tableau to create a visual representation of the data, and they employ a generative AI platform such as ChatGPT to help them decipher their findings.\n",

In addition, the fields used in multiple datasets often don’t match up, so they must be separated and standardized. This time-consuming task might not be glamorous, but it’s a necessary skill for our students to learn. In fact, research indicates that up to 80 percent of the analysis process is devoted to just prepping the data.\n",

Students are required to choose companies with raw datasets that require significant pre-processing, then use AI tools to analyze issues these companies are facing and develop potential solutions.

      "**Complexity Analysis:** The quiz questions are relatively straightforward, but the language used is somewhat formal and technical, which may pose a challenge for some students. The questions require basic knowledge of data analysis and AI platforms, but the options provided are not overly complex. Overall, I would rate the complexity level as 6/10.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Question 1: This question is clear and concise, but the answer \"Cleaning the data\" might be too specific, as students may not always encounter data cleaning challenges.\n",
      "2. Question 2: This question requires basic math skills, but the answer \"80%\" seems arbitrary and may not be universally applicable.\n",
      "3. Question 3: This question is straightforward, but the correct answer \"Both A and B\" is not explicitly mentioned in the options, which may lead to confusion.\n",
      "4. Question 4: This question is well-written, but the answer \"To show the impact and potential of technology\" is a bit vague and may not be directly related to the case studies.\n",
      "5. Question 5: This question is clear, but the answer \"Both words and numbers\" is not explicitly mentioned in the options, which may lead to confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Update Question 1 to make it more general, e.g., \"What is a common challenge students face when working on project assignments?\"\n",
      "* Update Question 2 to provide more context or clarify the percentage, e.g., \"What percentage of the analysis process is typically devoted to data preparation?\"\n",
      "* Update Question 3 to provide explicit options for \"Both A and B\" or rephrase the question to avoid ambiguity.\n",
      "* Update Question 4 to provide more specific information about the case studies, e.g., \"What is the primary purpose of the case studies in the analytics curriculum?\"\n",
      "* Update Question 5 to provide explicit options for \"Both words and numbers\" or rephrase the question to avoid ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tone:** The tone of the quiz is formal and technical, which may be suitable for advanced students. However, for beginner students, a more conversational tone may be more engaging and accessible. Consider using simpler language and shorter sentences to make the quiz more approachable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Consider adding more questions that focus on critical thinking and problem-solving skills, rather than just recalling facts.\n",
      "* Use more diverse and inclusive language to make the quiz more welcoming to students from different backgrounds.\n",
      "* Provide clear instructions and explanations for each question to help students understand what is expected of them. \n",
